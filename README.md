# Continuous Integration with QML in Go
An experiment to set up continuous integration services with [niemeyer/qml](http://github.com/niemeyer/qml). I'm planning some projects with this library so I'm going to get the CI stuff out of the way on a repo that doesn't actually have anything useful in it. Then, when I actually want to make stuff, I'll already know how to set up CI for my projects.

## License
I don't consider a handful of YAML files to be license-worthy, so there is no license for my "content" (if it can even be called that). The Go/QML example code comes from [niemeyer/qml](http://github.com/niemeyer/qml/tree/master/examples/particle) which is under the [LGPL plus some kind of exception](https://github.com/niemeyer/qml/blob/master/LICENSE). IANAL. Please refer to the original license for details.
